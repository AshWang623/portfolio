# Summary
The fashion industry is a significant contributor to global pollution, with a vast environmental cost associated with clothing production, consumption, and disposal. This project aims to shed light on the ecological impact of different types of clothes, tracing the journey from raw material production to the final product consumers buy, and the waste created when clothes are discarded.

I will explore the types of materials used in clothing—such as cotton, polyester, and newer innovations like organic fabrics—and analyze how their production contributes to environmental issues such as water pollution, carbon emissions, and toxic chemical release. The project will also delve into the supply chain, examining the often-overlooked processes of garment manufacturing, dyeing, and transportation, which further exacerbate environmental damage.

A critical aspect of fashion pollution is the waste generated by discarded clothes. This project will also investigate where these clothes go—landfills, incineration, or second-hand markets—and highlight how much of this waste ends up in developing countries, creating environmental and social challenges.

Finally, I want to advocate for alternatives to traditional fashion consumption by promoting the idea of "organic fashion." This includes choosing sustainable materials, supporting ethical fashion brands, and encouraging recycling and reuse practices. By understanding the full environmental cost of our clothing choices, consumers can be empowered to make more sustainable fashion decisions and contribute to a cleaner planet.
