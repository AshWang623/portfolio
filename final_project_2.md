# User research 

## Target audience

The main audience is general customers interested in sustainability. These people are not necessarily familiar with environmental issues but care about the impact of their daily behaviors. The story aims to educate people about the facts behind the fashion industry and encourages shifts in consumption choices.

More specifically, I think the younger generations like the Millennials and Gen Z will be more interested in the topic. Youngsters are more likely to be swayed by fashion trends, yet also more open-minded and innovative in life styles.

Since I am a Millennial myself, my approach to identifying representative individuals to interview is screening from my own social circle. These are my screening criteria:

How often do they buy new clothes
Whether they consider the environmental impact when making purchasing decisions
