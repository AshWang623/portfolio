# User research 

## Target audience

The main audience is general customers interested in sustainability. These people are not necessarily familiar with environmental issues but care about the impact of their daily behaviors. The story aims to educate people about the facts behind the fashion industry and encourages shifts in consumption choices.

More specifically, I think the younger generations like the Millennials and Gen Z will be more interested in the topic. Youngsters are more likely to be swayed by fashion trends, yet also more open-minded and innovative in lifestyles.

Since I am a Millennial myself, my approach to identifying representative individuals to interview is screening from my own social circle. These are my screening criteria:

 - Whether they often buy new clothes for fashion
  
 - Whether they consider the environmental impact when making purchasing decisions

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Evaluate the effectiveness of data visualizations    |  Were there any parts of the visualization that felt confusing or difficult to interpret?  What additional information may help to resolve confusion?            |
|  Evaluate whether the story is engaging    | Were there any specific sections of the story that resonated with you? What parts of the story felt less engaging?                |
|  Evaluate whether the story incentivizes people to make changes   | After seeing the story, do you feel motivated to make changes in your clothing choices? What barriers might prevent you from taking the actions suggested in the story?                |


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Evaluate the effectiveness of data visualizations | The radar chart was interesting, but it felt a little overwhelming.|It would be better if the color of fabrics in the radar chart matched the market share.| Some of the charts were hard to follow just because of how quickly you skimmed through. Maybe you could make it easier by highlighting the key takeaway in bold.|
| Evaluate whether the story is engaging | The introduction was good, but some of the stats felt heavy and a bit technical. |I like the storytelling around the different materials. I didn’t know how much synthetic fabrics contributed to pollution, and that was a powerful moment.| It’s eye-opening to see how even donating clothes can have a negative impact. But I'm not sure how the supply chain part is connected to the overall problem |
| Evaluate whether the story incentivizes people to make changes   |I still care about styles and trends. I might look into eco-friendly options if they were fashionable.| It makes people think but necessarily take action. Buying second-hand seems like a hassle.| It definitely makes me think. But I wish sustainable fashion were more affordable. Cost is a major barrier. |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The radar chart was most discussed and well-received but a little overwhelming. | Highlight key insights within the visualization itself and its connection with the market share chart. |
| The supply chain section felt unnecessary with less immediate engagement compared to other sections. |  Condense the supply chain story, maybe combine it with another section. |
| Participants resonate most positively with the "afterlife of clothes" section, especially regarding the impact of clothing waste. |  Expand the "afterlife of clothes" section with more compelling visuals.|
| Some participants expressed that sustainable fashion options seem costly or inconvenient, and they are not sure if they will make changes in clothes consumption. | Introduce sustainable fashion more clearly and provide more concrete actionable suggestions.|
| ...add more rows as necessary            |                                                                                 |
