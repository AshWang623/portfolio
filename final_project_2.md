# User research 

## Target audience

The main audience is general customers interested in sustainability. These people are not necessarily familiar with environmental issues but care about the impact of their daily behaviors. The story aims to educate people about the facts behind the fashion industry and encourages shifts in consumption choices.

More specifically, I think the younger generations like the Millennials and Gen Z will be more interested in the topic. Youngsters are more likely to be swayed by fashion trends, yet also more open-minded and innovative in life styles.

Since I am a Millennial myself, my approach to identifying representative individuals to interview is screening from my own social circle. These are my screening criteria:

 - Whether they often buy new clothes for fashion
  
 - Whether they consider the environmental impact when making purchasing decisions

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Evaluate the effectiveness of data visualizations    |  Were there any parts of the visualization that felt confusing or difficult to interpret?  What additional information may help to resolve confusion?            |
|  Evaluate whether the story is engaging    | Were there any specific sections of the story that resonated with you? What parts of the story felt less engaging?                |
|  Evaluate whether the story incentivizes people to make changes   | After seeing the story, do you feel motivated to make changes in your clothing choices? What barriers might prevent you from taking the actions suggested in the story?                |


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Evaluate the effectiveness of data visualizations | The radar chart was interesting, but it felt a little overwhelming.|It would be better if the color of fabrics in the radar chart matched the market share.|             |
| Evaluate whether the story is engaging | The introduction was good, but some of the stats felt heavy and a bit technical. |   Itâ€™s eye-opening to see how even donating clothes can have a negative impact. But I'm not sure how the supply chain part is connected to the overall problem|             |
| Evaluate whether the story incentivizes people to make changes   |I still care about styles and trends. I might look into eco-friendly options if they were fashionable.| It makes people think but necessarily take action. Buying second-hand seems like a hassle.| It definitely make me think. But I wish sustainable fashion were more affordable. Cost is a major barrier. |

| ...add more rows as necessary            |                                                                                 |
